In the Boston House Price Prediction project, I undertook the challenge of building a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on the renowned Boston Housing dataset. The code involved several crucial steps, starting with data loading and preprocessing, followed by feature engineering to extract relevant information from the dataset. I then employed the powerful Linear Regression algorithm to train the model on the training data and make predictions on the test set. Additionally, to gain deeper insights into the model's performance and the data patterns, I incorporated insightful visualizations. These visualizations effectively showcased the predicted vs. actual house prices and provided an in-depth view of the feature values for sample data points. The successful completion of this task not only improved my expertise in regression algorithms and data visualization but also highlighted the real-world applicability of machine learning in the domain of housing price prediction.
